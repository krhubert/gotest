// Parse parses a formatted string and returns the time value it represents.
// See the documentation for the constant called [Layout] to see how to
// represent the format. The second argument must be parseable using
// the format string (layout) provided as the first argument.
//
// The example for [Time.Format] demonstrates the working of the layout string
// in detail and is a good reference.
//
// When parsing (only), the input may contain a fractional second
// field immediately after the seconds field, even if the layout does not
// signify its presence. In that case either a comma or a decimal point
// followed by a maximal series of digits is parsed as a fractional second.
// Fractional seconds are truncated to nanosecond precision.
//
// Elements omitted from the layout are assumed to be zero or, when
// zero is impossible, one, so parsing "3:04pm" returns the time
// corresponding to Jan 1, year 0, 15:04:00 UTC (note that because the year is
// 0, this time is before the zero Time).
// Years must be in the range 0000..9999. The day of the week is checked
// for syntax but it is otherwise ignored.
//
// For layouts specifying the two-digit year 06, a value NN >= 69 will be treated
// as 19NN and a value NN < 69 will be treated as 20NN.
//
// The remainder of this comment describes the handling of time zones.
//
// In the absence of a time zone indicator, Parse returns a time in UTC.
//
// When parsing a time with a zone offset like -0700, if the offset corresponds
// to a time zone used by the current location ([Local]), then Parse uses that
// location and zone in the returned time. Otherwise it records the time as
// being in a fabricated location with time fixed at the given zone offset.
//
// When parsing a time with a zone abbreviation like MST, if the zone abbreviation
// has a defined offset in the current location, then that offset is used.
// The zone abbreviation "UTC" is recognized as UTC regardless of location.
// If the zone abbreviation is unknown, Parse records the time as being
// in a fabricated location with the given zone abbreviation and a zero offset.
// This choice means that such a time can be parsed and reformatted with the
// same layout losslessly, but the exact instant used in the representation will
// differ by the actual zone offset. To avoid such problems, prefer time layouts
// that use a numeric zone offset, or use [ParseInLocation].

	}
	return p0
}

// ParseInLocation is like Parse but differs in two important ways.
// First, in the absence of time zone information, Parse interprets a time as UTC;
// ParseInLocation interprets the time as in the given location.
// Second, when given a zone offset or abbreviation, Parse tries to match it
// against the Local location; ParseInLocation uses the given location.
